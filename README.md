## Stanford - Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning - CS224n 

Natural language processing (NLP) or computational linguistics is one of the most important technologies of the information age. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate almost everything in language: web search, advertising, emails, customer service, language translation, virtual agents, medical reports, politics, etc. In the last decade, deep learning (or neural network) approaches have obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks, using single end-to-end neural models that do not require traditional, task-specific feature engineering. In this course, students will gain a thorough introduction to cutting-edge research in Deep Learning for NLP. Through lectures, assignments and a final project, students will learn the necessary skills to design, implement, and understand their own neural network models, using the Pytorch framework.

Note: 2019 lectures by Anand Avati are better and have review of concepts for first lectures.

## Stanford - Deep Learning for Computer Vision - CS231n

Computer Vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, image understanding, apps, mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars. Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification, localization and detection. Recent developments in neural network (aka “deep learning”) approaches have greatly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. This course is a deep dive into the details of deep learning architectures with a focus on learning end-to-end models for these tasks, particularly image classification. During the 10-week course, students will learn to implement and train their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. Additionally, the final assignment will give them the opportunity to train and apply multi-million parameter networks on real-world vision problems of their choice. Through multiple hands-on assignments and the final course project, students will acquire the toolset for setting up deep learning tasks and practical engineering tricks for training and fine-tuning deep neural networks.

## UW - Madison - Introduction to Machine Learning and Statistical Pattern Classification - STAT 451

Introduction to machine learning for pattern classification, regression analysis, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. For each category, fundamental algorithms, as well as selections of contemporary, current state-of-the-art algorithms, are being discussed. The evaluation of machine learning models using statistical methods is a particular focus of this course. Statistical pattern classification approaches, including maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian decision theory, are compared and contrasted to algorithmic and nonparametric approaches. While fundamental mathematical concepts underlying machine learning and pattern classification algorithms are being taught, the practical use of machine learning algorithms using open source libraries from the Python programming ecosystem will be of equal focus in this course.

## UC Berkely - Advanced Robotics - CS 287

Over the past ten years advances in optimization, in probabilistic reasoning, and in machine learning have had a large impact in robotics, with many of the current state-of-the-art algorithms heavily relying on these tools. At the same time these three tools have wide applicability in many other fields. The current curriculum of CS287 is centered around these three tools---making it both a treatment of these tools (in the context of a specific application domain, namely robotics), as well as a treatment of the state of the art in (algorithmic) robotics. Problem sets are a mix of mathematical/algorithmic questions and programming problems. There is a substantial final project. NOTE: This course is about algorithms for robotics, and does *not* cover hardware aspects. PREREQS: Familiarity with mathematical proofs, probability, algorithms, linear algebra; ability to implement algorithmic ideas in code.

## Carnegie Mellon University - MultiModal Machine Learning - 11-777 • Fall 2022 

Multimodal machine learning (MMML) is a vibrant multi-disciplinary research field which addresses some of the original goals of artificial intelligence by integrating and modeling multiple communicative modalities, including linguistic, acoustic, and visual messages. With the initial research on audio-visual speech recognition and more recently with language & vision projects such as image and video captioning, this research field brings some unique challenges for multimodal researchers given the heterogeneity of the data and the contingency often found between modalities. This course will teach fundamental mathematical concepts related to MMML including multimodal alignment and fusion, heterogeneous representation learning and multi-stream temporal modeling. We will also review recent papers describing state-of-the-art probabilistic models and computational algorithms for MMML and discuss the current and upcoming challenges.
